# circuit

Circuit is a general purpose operating system targeting standard desktops and laptops.

## Planned Features
- Support x86_64, AArch64 and RISC-V
- First class Zig support
- Userspace with GUI
- Linux syscall compatibility mode (allowing static linux binaries to run unchanged)

## Long Term Goal
All functionality implemented in Zig either in repo or as a package.

Allowances might be made for things like [ACPICA](https://acpica.org/).
