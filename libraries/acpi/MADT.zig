/// The ACPI interrupt model describes all interrupts for the entire system in a uniform interrupt model implementation.

/// Supported interrupt models include:

/// The choice of interrupt model(s) to support is up to the platform designer.

/// The interrupt model cannot be dynamically changed by system firmware; OSPM will choose which model to use and

///
/// Therefore to support APICs, SAPICs, GICs, or LPICs on an ACPI-enabled system, each used interrupt input must be
